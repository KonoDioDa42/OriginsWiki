				The <b>Missing File</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Magic_Weapons.html">magic weapon</a> found in <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Dungeon_Chest.html">Defiled Dungeon Chests</a>.
				Selecting it in the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hotbar">hotbar</a> while enemies are nearby causes several icons to pop up for the player to click on with the cursor.
				Whenever the correct correspondent icon is selected for the enemy the player desires to attack, all copies of that enemy on screen get dealt substantial damage from spikes growing out of their chest, and a meowing noise can be heard.
				When the wrong icon is selected, it does nothing and changes the icons that are on screen.
