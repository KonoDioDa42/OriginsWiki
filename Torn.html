				<b>Torn</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="Debuffs.html">debuff</a> that is applied by most items and enemies found in the <a is="a-link">Riven Hive</a>.
				When applied to an NPC, they will receive more damage from the player depending on the severity of the Torn being applied.
				When applied to a player, they will instead have their max <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health">life</a> according to the severity applied.
