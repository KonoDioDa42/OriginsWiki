				The <b>Carpalfish</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> that spawns in the <a is="a-link">Brine Pool</a>.
				It will swim like most fish and charge at the player at a fast speed after building-up the attack.
				It will charge at the player even if separated by a wall as long as the player is submerged in <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Water">water</a>.
				If the Carpalfish collides with a solid surface while attempting to hit the player, it has a chance to drop a <a is="a-link">Venom Fang</a>.
				Like all enemies in the Brine Pool, it will attack anything that isn't a member of its species.
