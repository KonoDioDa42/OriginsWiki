						- Hello my name on the internet is "chrersis" and I'm an aspiring freelance video game developer working with the Origins Team to fulfill our dreams together.
					   I come from a background as a gamer enjoying a lot of different games such as <a is="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechAssault">Mechassault</a> (my favorite game of all time).
					   The idea of Origins came up in my mind back in 2017 and, at the time, was just an idea with a couple of early rendition sprites of some things in the mod.
					   I met my best friend Tyfyter that same year and it eventually came to the topic of how cool Terraria is, which transformed into us beginning our partnership.
					   For the following three years, we were just planning the mod and letting it sit in the background, but around 2020 we started making progress as we saw the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/1.4.0.1">Journey's End</a> update had been coming around and that official TModLoader support would be brought into Steam.
					   We've been very dedicated to the mod ever since and have big plans for it.
				   </p>

						- Throughout Origins' development, I've tried to work on all of the aspects of the mod to help make it easier for Ty to program.
					   Until recently, I've started to learn basic programming and have been working on the simpler concepts.
					   I've been the only spriter and composer for this mod since its fruition so those are my main strengths in the development scene.
					   I used to be novice at both spriting and music composition for the 7 years this project was conceptualized, but with lots of practice and dedication I eventually got competent at these skills.
					   Learning Terraria's art direction was pretty easy as there were hundreds of items and enemies to use as an example, music on the other hand is still tricky for me.
					   My compositional skills are limited to the <a is="a-link" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/">GarageBand</a> app, which is where all of Origins' current music is made.
				   </p>
   
				   <p>
						- In the future, I hope I can make all of my childhood ideas come true in varying forms of media.
					   I've always had a huge creative background in life and love to make ideas out of my dreams.
					   Origins is my very first project of large scale, and what was once just 4 sprites and a paragraph, is now a decently-sized content mod.
					   I really hope to share my ideas with the world as I want to inspire others to never give up on their own ideas.
					   I am really grateful of all the friends and family that have supported me all these years to keep me going and never giving up.
