				The <b>Bone Latcher</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Melee_Weapons.html">melee weapon</a> that has a 1/38 (2.63%) chance of being dropped by <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Cyclops.html">Defiled Cyclopes</a>, or can be crafted using <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Bar.html">Defiled Bars</a>.
				The Bone Latcher behaves like a <a is="a-link" href="Whips.html">whip</a> despite being a melee weapon except that it pulls enemies that are 12 or greater tiles away from the player towards the player instead of knocking them back.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its best <a is="a-link" href="Modifiers.html">modifier</a> is <b>Legendary</b>.
				Modifiers that affect weapon <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Knockback">knockback</a> instead increase the beckoning force of the Bone Latcher.

					 - The Bone Latcher has an excellent <a is="a-link" href="Item_Synergies.html">synergy</a> with <a is="a-link">Soulhide Armor</a> due to its ability to pull enemies toward you.
					 Combined with Soulhide Armor, you can wither enemies down by inflicting them with the weaker <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shadowflame">Shadowflame</a> <a is="a-link" href="Debuffs.html">debuff</a> provided by Soulhide's set bonus.

				<p>
					 - The Bone Latcher as it was planned was originally going to be planned for the release of Origins before Terraria 1.4 came out.
					 Origins was never released before 1.4 or even during 1.4, so it behaves like a melee-ified whip as of now.
