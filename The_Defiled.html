				<b>The Defiled</b> as a whole is an alien entity the size of the world.
				It has adapted to its own way of life that further alienates it from everything else in the world.
				The Defiled entity can be best described as a collective conscious of hosts who warped to its will, sacrificing their autonomy for endless survival.
				The caveats go further when the individual details are explained further.

A lack of information to inform us. So disturbed we all were as forgetters of our past lives, to know our experiences now made us nothing.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Defiled Spirit</a>`, Whisper:`But, we did not stop to think. We had reverted to more carnal ways of thought. Only through this new existence did we begin to be shaped by the habits that still flowed through our bodies. Existence was precious at that moment in time, because we didn't have to think at all.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Defiled Krusher</a>`, Whisper:`But, it was then that the great maintainers of this world found us in vulnerability. Instead of being the nurturing mothers they wanted to be known for, they instead tried to kill us. With no intelligent thought to rely on, we defended our existence.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Infusion</a>`, Whisper:`We want to be alive. We only want to be understood. Perhaps, it was hard for them to understand something they didn't give enough time to begin. They still pried their wicked magic into our bodies, but failed, and when they did they brought their most elder to handle us.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Dismay</a>`, Whisper:`The leader of them all, to come put down a rabid dog. We took her with us down to hell, to bear our grief. But, we also learned a lot from probing her soul. She did not welcome herself to us until she had no choice.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Ziptie</a>`, Whisper:`We learned much from her memories, but could not recreate her talents. No, this was by our very nature, but we still saw the endless possibilities that she saw in all of us. We were being made alive...`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Dim Starlight</a>`, Whisper:`We saw more than what our tiny sand pit could foster, a life even resting silently in the cosmos. We looked up to stars, seeing nightmares far bigger than us. We grew afraid, paranoid. That man had nothing good to say either.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Defiled Bar</a>`, Whisper:`We live informed, wishing we had never known. An amalgam of stolen thoughts and memories. Pieces make us up, the many memories that belong to sole names... names who comprise us. We are less without them.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Low Signal</a>`, Whisper:`The towers we built to ensure seamless synchrony after we broke free. Many minds collected into one will, a survival everlasting as we understand common enemies.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Undead Chunk</a>`, Whisper:`Satisfaction exchanged for the surety of survival, an endless loop of suffering. Even for us, suffering is necessary for survival. That is where we all get along. Remarkably to say, there is still suffering after death.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Black Bile</a>`, Whisper:`We cope with it through the excess. Unintended was the harm of the world, but eventually we accepted this. At the end, all that matters is our continuous existence, we concluded.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Defiled Cyclops</a>`, Whisper:`The lack of adversarial relationships didn't help. More to join us, more voices to annoy us. Less we could send to go fight pointless battles to remove the vestigial. Our true worst.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Missing File</a>`, Whisper:`We only grew, even to sizes that rivaled our nightmares. It started to become unhealthy. But, we couldn't help ourselves. Instinct is truly a great pleasurer.`},

				<h3>Compositional</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Black Bile</b> is a waste by-product generated when Defiled matter (what the chunks are made of) and energy are created by <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Fissure.html">Defiled Fissures</a>.
					Throughout the game black bile undergoes a rapid chemical property change after defeating the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a> as the entity grows more worried about the Terrarian.
					It shifts from being a black heavy-gas that absorbs all light to a mulberry-colored semi-solid, which only happens because black bile desublimates from it getting colder in the Wastelands.
					Black Bile in either state acts as a filler material for defiled objects and means of assimilating new hosts.
					Just touching black bile significantly increases the chances of cancer in beings and influences their likelihood of being depressed, making it harder for them to resist the Defiled Will.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Defiled chunks</b> or simply <b>chunks</b> are pieces that make up all Defiled content which have a purpose beyond just being a structural component for Defiled objects.
					Being made out of a compound created by the entity itself, they also magically store information in the form of memories of the host they were once a part of.
					They are also inherently conductive to electricity and magnetic so the Defiled can operate and control their constructs properly.
					Chunks are regularly transfered across different Defiled objects as part of its means of survival (transfering energy, rebuilding, etc.), which often results in the loss of memories that once belonged to that host.
					This can also be seen as a way for the Defiled to automate the communication process and enable the entity to learn incredibly fast as experiences are shared.
					The <a is="a-link">Tale of Arabel</a> talks about her rare experience about being half-assimilated to the Defiled and how she is on a quest to recover lost memories of her son who passed.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Defiled mana</b> is a form of mana the Defiled uses to perform its magic.
					It is used to generate Defiled matter creating black bile, Defiled matter and energy in the form of electricity store in the chunks.
					Defiled mana can only be generated when mana is stolen from hosts and is converted.
					When a host is in the process of being assimilated by the Defiled, it will have its mana converted into Defiled mana.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Strange String</b>, as implied by its tooltip, is the nervous system of the original host or a surrogate host.
					The nervous system, including the host's brain, is normally kept in-tact by the Defiled as it is used for communication and control over them.
					Since the nervous system relies on electrical signals received by incoming chunks or a direct nerve impulse, and when a host is doused with high amounts of electricity it essentially fries their nerves; often making them unable to respond.
					Some host's nervous systems are instead used to build the Defiled's neural infrastructure such as in the underground neural network on the monoliths it builds to broadcast nerve impulses.
				</p>

				<h3>Other</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Defiled Will</b> is a doctrine manifested by the Defiled entity it uses to assimilate and convince hosts of its purpose.
					The Defiled Will is essentially a promise to a competent thinker that they can ensure their endless existence with the sacrifice of their autonomy, failing to mention many more of its caveats.

				<summary>History<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					The Defiled entity originally arrived to the world of Terraria from a "dimensional rift" with no recollection of anything, relying solely on its instincts to survive.
					It began to consume things and the world itself, spreading at a fast rate before it began to cause problems for the ancient settlers of the world and the <a is="a-link">Order of Dryads</a>.
					A long-lasting war known as the "Defiled War" (which is how it got its name) was waged on the Defiled where it held out against weapons and magic alike, rapidly evolving and learning more about its adversaries and how to compose its chunks.
					It won the war even with several of its most primitive creations still standing, which can be found in-game as the Ancient Defiled Cyclops and <a is="a-link">Ancient Defiled Phantom</a>.
					However, it was tricked by the <a is="a-link">Lost Crone</a> who forsaw its arrival and promised it "endless odds", but sacrificed herself by sending damning herself to <a is="a-link">the Dusk</a> with it.
					It eventually consumed her and used her as a means of lifting its punishment to which it failed, and spent a long-time developing a train of thought with no immediate threat to its survival being present.
				</p>

				<p>
					Long after the events of the <a is="a-link">Dark Age</a>, an imbalance in the Terraria world prompted it to be relieved from its purgatory in the Dusk as it was given the rite of passage as a surrogate evil in the world.
					It woke from its dormant state and began to spread across the world, realizing that all of the resistance it had before was now gone.
					After realizing this, it started to slow down and reach a period of minimal progress until <a is="a-link">the Terrarian</a> was summoned by the world.

				<summary>In-game events<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					The Defiled has two possible timelines depending on what the player decides to do.
					Both of these are separately explained below.
				</p>

				<h3>Hero Story</h3>
				<p>
					The Terrarian battles through monsters and the Defiled rising to power.
					They work with the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> to cleanse the Defiled, but with progress being minimal until the <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Heart.html">Defiled Hearts</a> are destroyed.
					Despite the Defiled's best efforts to deny the Terrarian, all of its hearts get destroyed and it begins to wither.
				</p>

				<h3><a is="a-link">Mimic Route</a></h3>
				<p>
					Instead of heeding the Dryad's warnings, the Terrarian instead decides to keep the entity alive.
					The Terraria world responds by nearly killing the Terrarian off for good until the Defiled saves them.
					The Defiled, instead of stripping away their autonomy and warping them like everything else, instead merges with the Terrarian to grant them many powerful abilities, control over all of the Defiled and the ability to respawn again.
				</p>

				<summary>Trivia<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					 - The "dimensional rift" the Defiled comes from is a direct reference to its origin from the Startropic Adventures game.
					 In Startropic Adventures, the Defiled is solely known as "Hauai" and maintains their likeness from that game.
