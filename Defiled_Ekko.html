				The <b>Defiled Ekko</b> is an <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> found in the <a is="a-link">Defiled Wastelands</a> all throughout the game after the player has reached 400 max <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health">life</a>.
				Defiled Ekkoes follow the behaviors of <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">Town NPCs</a>, except with hostility towards the player and various weapons they could use.
				Defiled Ekkoes can use their own version of the <a is="a-link">Infusion</a>, <a is="a-link">Dismay</a> and <a is="a-link">Bone Latcher</a> that each scale with difficulty.
				In <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">Master Mode</a>, Defiled Ekkoes gain the benefits of <a is="a-link">Mysterious Spray</a> once <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> is reached.

					 - The best way to handle Defiled Ekkoes is to build barriers to avoid them if possible, however, if a confrontation is necessary, use <a is="a-link" href="Demolitionist_Weapons.html">explosives</a> to make haste of them.
					Like most Defiled enemies, they are prone to high bursts of damage.
