				The <b>Protomind</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Accessories.html">accessory</a> combining a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Confusion">Brain of Confusion</a> with the <a is="a-link">Potato Battery</a>.
				When equipped, enemies have a 3/5 (60%) chance of receiving the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Confused">Confused</a> <a is="a-link" href="Debuffs.html">debuff</a> for a minimum of 1.5 seconds.
				The chance, duration, and area of effect of the debuff are based on the amount of damage taken.
				Additionally, all magic projectiles home towards enemies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the player wielding it has a 1/6 (16.67%) chance of dodging an attack, which inflicts the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Confusion">Cerebral Mindtrick</a> debuff on them for 4 seconds.
				Despite being a debuff, it increases <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Critical_hit">critical strike</a> chance and <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage#Summon">summon damage</a> by 10%.
				While the debuff is active, the player cannot dodge another attack.
