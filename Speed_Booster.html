				The <b>Speed Booster</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Accessories.html">accessory</a> combining the <a is="a-link">Automated Returns Handler</a> with the <a is="a-link" href="Lovers_Leap.html">Lover's Leap</a>.
				When equipped, the player has the ability to climb and slide down walls, a 10% chance to dodge any attack, an increased return speed for <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hooks">hooks</a> and <a is="a-link" href="Harpoon_Guns.html">harpoons</a> by 2, and the ability to run fast while having a 20% increase in damage and 50% increase in movement speed after taking damage.
				Beyond the effects of its predecessors, it also grants an improved dash ability by double-tapping the horizontal or vertical movement keys aftering building momentum.
				Momentum gained by the player can be preserved for 3 additional seconds, allowing instant acceleration/deceleration and a boost to jump and flight speeds.

			<p>
				The dash provided by Speed Booster can deal incredible damage to an enemy the player comes in contact with and knock them back.
				It also allows the player to travel great distances until colliding with a tile or after a brief moment.
