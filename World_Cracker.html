				The <b>World Cracker</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a>, <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Hive.html">Riven</a>-themed <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Worm_AI">worm</a> <a is="a-link" href="Bosses.html">boss</a>.
				It is summoned when three <a is="a-link" href="Gel_Blister.html">Gel Blisters</a> are destroyed in a Riven world, or when a player uses <a is="a-link">Suspicious Looking Ice Cream</a> anywhere in the Riven Hive or <a is="a-link">Underground Riven Hive</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The World Cracker has a very simple behavior, however, there are a few quirks that make it quite challenging.
				It has a total of 15/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">17</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">19</a> segments including the head and tail, and it all counts as one unlike the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eater_of_Worlds">Eater of Worlds</a>.
				It will circle around the player and move in the opposite direction of the player, making its movement unpredictable.
				While moving around it will shoot amoeba bubbles from any one of its segments that deals high damage.
				Furthermore, the World Cracker has armor on all of its segments that reduce damage until it is destroyed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Defeating the World Cracker and destroying its armor are the only ways of obtaining <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Carapace.html">Riven Carapace</a>, and are one of the ways of obtaining usable quantities of <a is="a-link">Encrusted Ore</a> alongside the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a>.
				Defeating the World Cracker for the first time also allows the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep">Tavernkeep</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> to spawn as the Unconcious Man, and allows <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)">meteorites</a> to land.

					<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
					<p>
						 - Focus on speed when preparing for the World Cracker as it attacks vertically, allowing you to easy sidestep it with enough acceleration.<br>
						 - Moving really fast horizontally or keeping the World Cracker in the circular motion around you in harder difficulties reduces the likelihood of getting hit by its amoeba bubbles.
